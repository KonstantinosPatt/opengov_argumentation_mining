The current legislative adjustment does not go far enough.
I am in favor of expanding the framework regarding voting rights for Greeks abroad.
The law 4648/2019, even with its restrictions, distorted the free expression of the popular will of the residents of Greece regarding ideology, economy, and politics.

The proposed bill meets the long-standing requests and dreams of Greeks abroad and all Greeks who understand the importance of Greece maintaining close ties with the Greek diaspora.
All restrictions and criteria for all Greeks abroad should be lifted.
Any failure to facilitate the exercise of the voting rights of Greek expatriates makes Greek citizens residing abroad second-class citizens.
