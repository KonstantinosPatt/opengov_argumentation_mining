*   **Count:** 25

*   **Summary:** This group expresses opposition to granting voting rights to Greeks abroad, or raises significant concerns about the potential negative consequences.  Arguments include that non-residents should not decide the fate of residents, that they lack sufficient connection to Greece, and that it could distort the will of the Greek people. Some claims express resentment at the idea of diaspora voters influencing domestic policy. There are also concerns about the potential for manipulation or unfair influence on election outcomes.

*   The law 4648/2019, even with its restrictions, distorted the free expression of the popular will of the residents of Greece regarding ideology, economy, and politics.
*   Residents abroad should not have the right to vote for those who will govern me.
*   The proposed legislative initiative is not moving in the right direction and endangers the interests of Greeks abroad.
*   The bill raises concerns about the potential for Greeks abroad to disproportionately influence the election outcome.
*   The discussion about voting from abroad should not even exist in Greece in 2023.
*   If permanent residents abroad without a tax number or social security number are given the right to vote simply because they are of Greek descent, then thousands of non-Greeks who permanently reside in the country should also be given the right to vote.
*   It isn't fair and right for Greeks who permanently reside abroad to vote without restrictions.
*   Greeks living abroad should not be allowed to vote.
*   It is wrong to consider the right to vote for Greeks abroad as a 'diaspora vote' because it's about Greek citizens already registered in electoral rolls.
*   It is a disgrace that this bill was passed.
*   It is not reasonable for a Greek citizen who has chosen to live and work abroad permanently to vote in Greek elections.
*   It is unacceptable for people who no longer live permanently in Greece to vote for Greece and its laws.

*   The proposed bill regarding the special electoral rolls for overseas voters is moving in a clearly wrong direction.

*   It is undemocratic and unfair for someone who does not live in Greece and will not suffer the consequences of their choice to have the right to decide for the residents of Greece.
*   It is not fair for legal and permanent residents abroad who have acquired the right to vote in the country where they reside to also have the right to vote in Greece.
*   It is unfair for people who don't live permanently in a country and are not directly affected by its policies to have a say in the election of its governments.
*   People born abroad, not living in Greece, not paying taxes, and possibly not having visited the country for years, should not be allowed to vote and determine the future of residents and their families.
*   I am against this bill.
*   My aunt from Chicago, who emigrated in the 60s and visits every decade for vacation, will decide on my pension and the benefits I want.
*   It is unthinkable for citizens of another country, who do not live permanently or even occasionally in Greece, to have the right to vote and shape election results.
*   A heavily indebted country should first solve the major problems of the residents who live, work, and pay taxes in GREECE, and not increase the number of ministries or create additional expenses in the budget.
